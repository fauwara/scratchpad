# webdev roadmap

## before we get started some FAQ
how much of one subject/topic do I need to read 

## HTML
- defines the structure of the webpage
- while learning **build your portfolio**, include stuff like hobbies, fav songs, series youve been watching and something about your self.

### Resources
*All of these resources can be found simply by googling it, but ik it can be intimidating at first so here are some, but build a good practice of googling resources. no one will/ have the time to help you out in an actual workspace.*

*\* authors are who I prefer*

| author          | desc                             |link                                |

## CSS
- styling the webpage
- style your portfolio(the one you built while learning HTML)
- learn **flex box** (check resources)

## Git and GitHub
- install [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) there is nothing to learn in Github just creat an account.
- learn how to write **README files** (you dont have to mugup all the syntax just know it exists and where to find docs for it) its the best way to write documentation for me at least.
- upload your projects there using git or drag and drop any is fine at this stage.
- figure out GitHub pages and host your static website ie. your portfolio.

## GitHub vs Git
understand the difference between Git and Github, they arent the same.

git might take a month or so of active using to really learn understand what it is doing and why. where as GitHub will only take about 30-45 mins of browsing around the platform.

NOTE:
if you feel intimidated to learn Git skip it for now and come back later (having experiences with the terminal or powershell/command prompt may help in learning git) you can upload your projects using drag and drop

you do not have to learn all the different version control actions or making pull requests GitHub this comes with time so do not spend all of time learning these two technologies just create an account upload your project and keep using it you will learn the different actions and use cases while learning other stuff.

we are learning this early on to build a good habit of using github.

## JS
- finally an actual programming language.
- there are alot of concepts in javascripts if you are a complete beginner this might take up most of your time of learning, the best way is to implement what ever you learnt in your portfolio just console log everything there dont worry about your portfolio getting messy you can make another one.
- learn **DOM**, you might have a list of projects that are shownin the ofrmat of cards which keeps repeating for the n number of projects you have you can use DOM to automate that.
- learn **node js** a runtime compiiler for JS

computers/machines only know 1's and 0's so how does a computer understand something like `<h1>hello world</h1>` or `console.log('hello worl')` so check out what is a **compiler** how do these things get rendered etc. check out the **compuer science crash course** in this section.
